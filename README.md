# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide webpage was created to help me remember the crucial things that I've learned about the different programming languages that I've encountered. As well as, to test certain features that are newly learnt. It serves as a prototype hub and learning assistant, largely influenced by the typical notebook but for internet enthusiasts.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
